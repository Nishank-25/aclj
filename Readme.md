# A Compiler Learning Journey.(Inspired by [acwj](https://github.com/DoctorWkt/acwj "a compiler writing journey"))
Hey! Thanks to peek in here. Lets begin this journey together.
For now we have a basic scanner and parser.It can interpret
the arithmetic expressions.


# Build and default Test

```c
cmake ./  && make // to build the compiler
./test.sh // to test the compiler ( you can pass args)
```

# Debug Flags
```c
-Ptokens
-Past-without-precedence
```
